Primitives are basic geometric shapes such as cube, pyramid. Due to the pixel arrangement restriction, we only care about isometric primitives here.

Since now Pixas has a set of 5 primitive shapes, and more isometric primitives will be added into this engine in the future. These primitives are showed as follow:

To create different primitives, we need to create different dimension and color instance.
